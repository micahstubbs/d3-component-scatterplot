an [es2015](https://babeljs.io/learn-es2015/) iteration on the block [Scatter Plot with Menus](http://bl.ocks.org/curran/8c131a74b85d0bb0246233de2cff3f52) from [@currankelleher](https://twitter.com/currankelleher)

This example demonstrates usage of a new library called [d3-component](https://github.com/curran/d3-component) and [Redux](http://redux.js.org/) to create a scatter plot with menus for X, Y, and color, and some animations. It's an experiment to see how things play out when pairing D3 directly with Redux, without React in the middle.
